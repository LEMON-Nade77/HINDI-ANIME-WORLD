// ANIME DATA STORE
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the "database" for the simple backend. Edit this file
// to add your real anime + episodes. No build step needed —
// just commit and push, Vercel redeploys automatically.
//
// Each episode needs a `type` + `src`, and SHOULD have `duration`:
//   type: "iframe"  -> src is an embeddable player URL
//                       e.g. a Rumble embed: https://rumble.com/embed/XXXXXXX/
//   type: "mp4"     -> src is a direct link to a .mp4 / .m3u8 file
//   duration         -> episode length IN SECONDS (e.g. 24 min = 1440).
//                        Only used for "iframe" episodes — it powers
//                        auto-advance to the next episode, since the
//                        front end can't detect when a cross-origin
//                        iframe (Rumble, etc.) actually finishes playing.
//                        "mp4" episodes auto-advance natively and don't
//                        need this. If you skip `duration` on an iframe
//                        episode, auto-advance is simply skipped for it —
//                        the viewer still gets a manual "Next" button.
//   loadBufferSeconds -> OPTIONAL. Extra seconds added on top of
//                        `duration` before auto-advancing, to account for
//                        the embedded player's own loading/buffering time
//                        (the timer starts the instant the iframe is
//                        inserted, slightly before playback visually
//                        begins). Defaults to 4 seconds if omitted —
//                        increase it for a source that consistently loads
//                        slower than that.
