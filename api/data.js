// to add your real anime + episodes. No build step needed —
// just commit and push, Vercel redeploys automatically.

// ------------------ ANIME ENTRY METADATA --------------------
// banner            -> OPTIONAL. A direct high-resolution link to a 16:9
//                       widescreen image (.jpg, .png, .webp). This is used
//                       specifically for the homepage sliding spotlight banner.
//                       **Note:** The banner automatically spotlights only the 
//                       LATEST 5 uploaded anime items (based on their position 
//                       at the very end of this array). If you omit the `banner` 
//                       property, the system will fall back to using your `cover` art.
// cover             -> REQUIRED. A direct link to vertical poster art (approx 5:7 
//                       aspect ratio) used for the search lists and catalog grids.
//
// -------------------- EPISODE MANAGEMENT --------------------
// Each episode needs a `type` + `src`, and SHOULD have `duration`:
//   type: "iframe"  -> src is an embeddable player URL
//                       e.g. a Rumble embed: https://rumble.com/embed/XXXXXXX/
//   type: "mp4"     -> src is a direct link to a raw video file host
//                       e.g. https://yoursite.com/video.mp4 / .m3u8 streams

    synopsis: " From the songs of his mother’s heart to the whispers of a faithful God, David’s story begins in quiet devotion. When the giant Goliath rises to terrorize a nation, a young shepherd armed with only a sling, a few stones, and unshakable faith steps forward. Pursued by power and driven by purpose, his journey tests the limits of loyalty, love, and courage—culminating in a battle not just for a crown, but for the soul of a kingdom.  ",
